# Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project implements a **machine learning–based diabetes prediction system** using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier.  
The model predicts whether a patient is diabetic based on key medical attributes.

---

##  Features Used
The model is trained using the following features:
- Glucose  
- BloodPressure  
- Insulin  
- BMI  
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction  
- Age  

---

## Model Description
- **Algorithm:** Support Vector Machine (SVC)
- **Preprocessing:** StandardScaler
- **Problem Type:** Binary Classification
- **Evaluation Metric:** Accuracy

---

## Model Performance
- **Test Accuracy:** **0.7662** (≈ 76.6%)

This model represents a **simple baseline implementation** intended for learning and experimentation.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas  
- numpy

---

## Future Improvements
This is a **simple baseline SVM model**. The performance can be improved by:
- **Hyperparameter tuning** (C, kernel, gamma)
- Using **cross-validation**
- Trying **multiple models** (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, ANN)
- Applying **ensemble / multi-model approaches**
- Feature engineering and improved data preprocessing
