## Overview
This project is a **Streamlit-based application** that predicts multiple diseases using **pre-trained machine learning models**.  
The app currently supports predictions for:  
- **Diabetes**  
- **Heart Disease**  
- **Parkinson's Disease**  

> **Note:** The models are already trained on historical medical datasets and saved using **pickle**.  
> The app loads these pre-trained models to make predictions instantly, so no training is done within the app.
